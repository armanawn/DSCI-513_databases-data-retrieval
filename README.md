## Lab assignments

There will be one lab assignment per week. We will follow the standard MDS lab deadlines.

## Quizzes

Quizzes will be **open book**, meaning you may consult course materials, online sources, etc. However, communication with other people during the quiz is strictly forbidden. See the MDS quiz instructions [here](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/). For the dates/times of the quizzes, see the [MDS calendar](https://ubc-mds.github.io/calendar/).

## Installation

- The first step to setup the course's Conda environment is to run `conda install -c conda-forge nb_conda_kernels` in your **base** environment, but if you have done so already for another MDS course, skip this step.

- The Conda environment file for the course is [here](dsci513env.yml). To create the environment, run `conda env create -f dsci513env.yml` (you only need to do this once). Finally, select the `dsci513` kernel from within VS Code or JupyterLab.

## Course learning objectives

- Explain and justify the need for storing data in a database
- Describe tables, tuples, and attributes in the relational model
- Construct basic and advanced SQL statements to query relational databases
- Define and manipulate tables and tuples using data definition language
- Understand the usage of integrity constraints in relational databases
- Describe the concept of transactions and concurrency control
- Construct basic and advanced queries in a NoSQL DBMS
